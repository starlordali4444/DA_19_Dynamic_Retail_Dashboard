## Problem Statements Solved with Steps

### 1. **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**
   **Objective:** Calculate and display Total Sales, Total Profit, Total Quantity, Number of Orders, and Profit Margin dynamically.

   **Steps:**
   1. Import the **Orders Table** into Excel using Power Query.
   2. Create calculated columns for:
      - `Profit Margin` = `Profit / Sales`.
      - `Total Orders` = Count of `Order ID`.
   3. Use Excel formulas to calculate:
      - `Total Sales` = `=SUM(Sales)`.
      - `Total Profit` = `=SUM(Profit)`.
      - `Total Quantity` = `=SUM(Quantity)`.
   4. Build a dynamic KPI table and use symbols to enhance visual appeal (e.g., ðŸ’° for Total Sales).

### 2. **Sales and Profit Analysis**
   **Objective:** Visualize sales and profit trends over time to identify patterns.

   **Steps:**
   1. Create a **Pivot Table** with `Order Date` grouped by Year and Month.
   2. Add `Sales` and `Profit` as values.
   3. Create a **Line Chart** to display trends for Sales and Profit.
   4. Apply slicers to filter by category, market, or region dynamically.

### 3. **Category-Wise Profit**
   **Objective:** Analyze profitability across product categories.

   **Steps:**
   1. Create a **Pivot Table** using `Category` as rows and `Profit` as values.
   2. Sort the table in descending order of Profit.
   3. Create a **Bar Chart** to visualize category-wise profit.
   4. Add slicers for interactivity (e.g., by region or year).

### 4. **Segment-Wise Sales Share (%)**
   **Objective:** Display the proportion of sales for each customer segment.

   **Steps:**
   1. Create a **Pivot Table** with `Segment` as rows and `Sales` as values.
   2. Calculate percentage share using `=Sales / Total Sales * 100`.

### 6. **Top 5 Subcategories**
   **Objective:** Identify the top 5 performing subcategories.

   **Steps:**
